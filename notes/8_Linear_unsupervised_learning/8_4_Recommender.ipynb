    "Recommender systems are heavily used in e-commerce today, providing customers with personalized recommendations for products and services by using a consumer's previous purchasing and rating history, along with those of similar customers.  For instance, a movie provider like Netflix with millions of users and tens of thousands of movies, records users' reviews and ratings (typically in the form of a number on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the most favorable rating) in a large matrix such as the one illustrated below in the Figure. These matrices are very sparsely populated, since an individual consumer has likely rated only a small portion of the movies available. With this data available, online movie and commerce sites often use the unsupervised learning technique we discuss in this Section as their main technique for making personalized recommendations to customers regarding what they might like to watch / consume next. With the technique for producing personalized recommendations we discuss here - typically referred to as a *Recommender System* - we aim to intelligently guess the values of every missing entry in the ratings matrix (we *complete* the matrix).  Then, in order to recommend a new product to a given user, we examine our completely filled ratings matrix for products we have predicted the user would highly rate (and thus enjoy) and recommend these.

    "So far we have seen how the setup and cost function of the linear Recommender Systems model mirrors PCA very closely.

In the case of PCA, we saw in [Section 8.5](https://jermwatt.github.io/machine_learning_refined/notes/8_Linear_unsupervised_learning/8_5_Classic.html) how the additional assumption that our basis is *orthonormal* allowed us to derive mathematically simple forms for our ideal parameter vectors.  However here the additional wrinkle of the Recommender Systems model - that we only have access to data whose indices lie in the set $\\Omega$ - prohibits similar calculations.  Thus in short we must rely on an iterative method for learning ideal parameters here like gradient descent or coordinate / block-coordinate descent.  Here we show a few simple examples of minimizing the Recommender System Least Squares cost via gradient descent."

    "The sort of behavior seen here - where the cost value on the full original matrix reaches a minimum for some intermediary value of $K$ - is quite common.  This is due to the fact that as we increase $K$ here we begin - after a certain value (here $K = 2$) -  to fit very well to our known entries at the expense of generalization (i.e., we begin to fit worse to values we cannot see).  This *overfitting* problem is a common one we will address more systematically in the next Chapter.  "
