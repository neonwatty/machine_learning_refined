    "We have now seen three standard linear unsupervised learning models: PCA, Recommender Systems, and K-Means clustering.  Along the way we have also seen how the shape of the most fundamental of these three - PCA - shows up in the latter two both in how the problems are both framed and optimized.  In this Section we complete this picture, fully drawing out the connections major unsupervised learning methods have to PCA, by describing them in all through the singular lens of *matrix factorization*.  This will help further unify our view of linear unsupervised methods, opening the door to further common methods that are similar variations on the theme of PCA. "

This perspective on K-Means is particularly helpful, since in the natural derivation of K-Means shown in the previous Section K-Means is a somewhat heuristic algorithm (i.e., it is not tied to the minimization of a cost function, like every other method we discuss is).  One practical consequence of this is that - previously - we had no framework in which to judge how a single run of the algorithm was progressing.  Now we do.  Now we know that we can treat the K-Means algorithm precisely as we do every other optimization method we discuss - as a way of minimizing a particular cost function - and can use the cost function to understand how the algorithm is functioning."
