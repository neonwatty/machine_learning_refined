    "In the previous Chapter we discussed the fitting of a linear model to a set of input/output points - otherwise known as *linear regression*. In general all sorts of nonlinear phenomena present themselves, and the data they generate - whose input and output share a nonlinear relationship - are poorly modeled using a linear model, thus causing linear regression to perform rather poorly. This naturally leads to the exploration of fitting *nonlinear* functions to data, referred to in general as *nonlinear regression*."

    "In this Chapter we introduce the most popular form of nonlinear regression dealt with in machine learning - called *two-class classification*.  The first thing that distinguishes this kind of problem from the kind of regression we have seen thus far is *the data itself*, and more particularly *its output*: two-class classification datasets have output values that take on *only one of two values* with each value referred to as a *class*.  Common examples of two class classification problems include face and general object detection, with classes consisting of with a face or object versus non-facial/object images, textual sentiment analysis where classes consist of written product reviews ascribing a positive or negative opinion, and automatic diagnosis of medical conditions where classes consist of medical data corresponding to patients who either do or do not have a specific malady.

    "This subtle difference is important, and spurs the development of new  cost functions that are better-suited to deal with such data.  Moreover - as we describe in this Chapter - these new cost functions are formulated based on a wide array of motivating perspectives - leading to *logistic regression*, the *perceptron*, and *support vector machines* perspectives on two-class classification.  While these perspectives widely differ on the surface they all - as we will see - reduce to virtually the same essential principle for two-class classification."
