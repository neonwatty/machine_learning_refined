    "In the [Section 9.3](https://jermwatt.github.io/machine_learning_refined/notes/9_Feature_engineer_select/9_3_Scaling.html) we saw how *feature scaling* via *standard normalization* - i.e., by subtracting off the mean of each input feature and dividing off its standard deviation - significantly improves the topology of a machine learning cost function enabling much more rapid minimization via first order methods like e.g., the generic gradient descent algorithm.  In this Section we describe how PCA is used to perform a more advanced form of standard normalization - commonly called *PCA sphereing* (also commonly referred to as *whitening*).  With this improvement on standard normalization we use PCA to rotate the mean-centered dataset so that its largest orthogonal directions of variance allign with the coordinate axes prior to scaling each input by its standard deviation.  This typically allows us to better compactify the data, resulting in a cost function whose contours are even more 'circular' than that provided by standard normalization and thus makes cost functions even easier to optimize.
