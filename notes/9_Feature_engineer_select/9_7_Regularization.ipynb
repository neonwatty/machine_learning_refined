    "With the first approach to feature selection discussed in the previous Section - *boosting* - we took a 'bottom-up' approach to feature selection: that is we began by tuning the bias and then added new features to our model one-at-a-time.  In this Section we introduce a complementary approach - called *regularization*.  Instead of building up a model 'starting at the bottom', with regularization we take a 'top-down' view and start off with a complete model that includes every one of our input features, and then we gradually remove input features of inferior importance.  We do this by adding a second function to our cost - called a *regularizer*  - that penalizes weights associated with less important input features."

    "While boosting is an efficient greedy scheme, the *regularization* idea detailed above can be computationally intensive to perform since for each value of $\\lambda$ tried a full run of local optimization must be completed.  On the other hand, while boosting is a 'bottom-up' approach that identifies individual features one-at-a-time, regularization takes a more 'top-down' approach and identifies important features *all at once*.  In principle this allows regularization to uncover groups of important features that may be correlated in such an interconnected way with the output that they will be missed by boosting."
