    "In this Section we discuss popular vector and matrix norms that will arise frequently in our study of machine learning, particularly when discussing regularization. A norm is a kind of function that measures the length of real vectors and matrices. The notion of length is extremely useful as it enables us to define distance - or similarity - between any two vectors (or matrices) living in the same space.  "

    "The $\\ell_{2}$, $\\ell_{1}$, and $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norms, by virtue of being vector norms, share a number of useful properties that we detail below.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Norms are always non-negative, that is $\\Vert\\mathbf{x}\\Vert\\geq 0$. Furthermore, the equality holds only when $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$. Therefore the norm of any nonzero vector is always greater than zero.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. The norm of $\\alpha\\mathbf{x}$, that is a scalar multiple of $\\mathbf{x}$, can be written in terms of the norm of $\\mathbf{x}$, as $\\Vert\\alpha\\mathbf{x}\\Vert=\\left|\\alpha\\right|\\Vert\\mathbf{x}\\Vert$. With $\\alpha=-1$ for example, we have that $\\Vert-\\mathbf{x}\\Vert=\\Vert\\mathbf{x}\\Vert$. \n",

Norms also satisfy the so-called *triangle inequality* where for any vectors $\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{y}$, and $\\mathbf{z}$ we have $\\Vert\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{z}\\Vert+\\Vert\\mathbf{z}-\\mathbf{y}\\Vert\\geq\\Vert\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}\\Vert$. As illustrated in the figure below for the $\\ell_{2}$ norm (left), the $\\ell_{1}$ norm (middle), and the $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm (right) the triangle inequality simply states that the distance between $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ is always smaller than (or equal to) the distance between $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{z}$, and the distance between $\\mathbf{z}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$, combined. In other words, if one wanted to travel from a given point $\\mathbf{x}$ to a given point $\\mathbf{y}$, it would be always better to travel directly from $\\mathbf{x}$ to $\\mathbf{y}$, than to travel\n",
    "first to a third point z, and then to y. With the change of variables $\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{z}$ and $\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{z}-\\mathbf{y}$, the triangle inequality is sometimes written in the simpler form of\n",
