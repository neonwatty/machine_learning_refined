These are the directions one must travel (in the input space) to increase / decrease the value of the line/hyperplane as quickly as possible.  Here we carry over the formulate from the previous Section, studying its impact on the scenario of the first order Taylor Series approximation (where our hyperplane is defined by a functions derivative(s)).
