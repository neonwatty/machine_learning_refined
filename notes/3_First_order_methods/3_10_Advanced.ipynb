    "In [Section 3.7](https://jermwatt.github.io/machine_learning_refined/notes/3_First_order_methods/3_7_Problems.html) we discussed two fundamental problems with the negative gradient insofar as it is used as a descent direction for local optimization: the zig-zagging and slow-crawling behaviors.  In the Sections that then followed we detailed fundamental solutions to each of these problems independently, momentum and gradient normalized descent.  These two fundamental problems can certainly occur together in practice, particularly with the sort of functions we minimize in machine learning (particularly those involving *neural networks*).  They both occur with functions that have flat long narrow valleys that provoke zig-zagging of gradient descent steps due to the shape of their contours, and slow crawling of the steps due to the area's flatness.
